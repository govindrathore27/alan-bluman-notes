    "Process of estimating the values of the parameters using imformation obtained from the samples.\\\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "1. The samples must be randomly selected.\n",
    "2. Sample size must be grater than 30 or the population must be normally distributed if sample size is less than 30.\n",

    "**Types of estimates :**\n",
    "- ## Point Estimates: \n",
    "It is a specific numerical value estimate of a parameter. The best point estimate for the mean is the sample mean.\n",
    "### Good Estimator(MVU estimator):\n",
    "    - **Unbiased** : Expected value of the estimates must be equal to the parameter being estimated.This simply means that the expected value which is theoretical average (hence includes value from all random samples ) must equal to the parameter.\n",
    "        - **Consistent** : As sample size increases , value of the estimator must approach the value of the parameter.\n",
    "        - **Smallest Variance** : Basically the estimator should have the minimum variance compared to other estimators, so that the value does not vary much from the parameter in each random sample.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- ## Interval Estimate:\n",
    "It is an interval or a range of values used to estimate the parameter. This estimate may or may not contain the value of the parameter being estimated.\n",
    "    - **Confidence Level**:It is the probability that the true parameter(population mean) lies in the interval when the sample size is sufficiently large and randomly selected.\n",
    "    - **Confidence Interval**: It is a specific interval estimate of a parameter determined by using data obtained from a sample and by using the specific confidence level of the estimate.\n",
    "    $$ \\bar{X} - z_{\\frac\\alpha2}.\\frac\\sigma{\\sqrt(n)} < \\mu < \\bar{X} + z_{\\frac\\alpha2}.\\frac\\sigma{\\sqrt(n)} $$\n",
    "        Note: Relationship of a and the confidence level is that the stated confidence level is the percentage equivalent to the decimal value of 1 - a.\n",
    "    - **Margin Of Error:** Also called the maximum error of the estimate is the maximum likely difference between the point estimate of a parameter and the actual value of the parameter.\n",
    "    $$z_{\\frac\\alpha2}.\\frac\\sigma{\\sqrt(n)}$$"
