    "Types of Probabilties:\n",
    "1. ### Classical Probability:\n",
    "    - It is the theoretical type, i.e., we don't perform any experiments in calculating this type of probability.\n",
    "    - In this we assume all the **events are equally likely to occur** , and hence calculate a specific probability which in theory is always right for a fair probability experiment.\n",
    "2. ### Emperical Probability:\n",
    "    - It is the probability we calculate by performing experiments.\n",
    "    - It sometimes varies from the classical probability because the number of trials is very less and there are chances of not getting perfect probability.\n",
    "    - We can get it to be equal to the classical probability using the **Law Of Large Numbers**,i.e., basically increasing the number of the trails.\n",
    "3. ### Subjective Probability:\n",
    "     - It is the probability value based on educated guess , employing someone's opionion or inexact information."
